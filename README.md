# Working with tidytext


## Summary

This session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022. This workshop will be given by two MPP students, Júlia Cots-Capell and Viktorija Ruzelyte. 

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the R package **tidytext**. This package will help us "tidy" our text data and treat text as data frames of individual words. By doing so, we will be able to manipulate, summarise and visualise the characteristics of text much easily. We will start with a brief presentation on the key characteristics of the package, followed by an explanation of the most relevant functions in the package. To do so, we will be working with different sources of text (such as article headlines, poems or books). We will also learn how to apply functions from other packages to our tidy data structures, and how to plot our results in a meaningful way. Lastly, during the on-site workshop, we will apply the learnt concepts to a real-case scenario and we will analyse "live" the inauguration speeches of Mr. Obama in 2009 and Mr. Trump in 2017.  


### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the tidytext package, (2) show you the key features of the package, (3) provide you with an understanding of the most important functions within the package, and (4) provide you with practice material.

## Statement of contributions

**Júlia Cots Capell** and **Viktorija Ruzelyte** worked collaboritavely in the preparation of the pre-recorded presentation (.Rmd file, slides, recording and video editing), as well as on the elaboration of the practise materials (design and development of the example).
